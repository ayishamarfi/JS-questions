---------------------MODULE 2------------------------------
---------------------JAVASCRIPT----------------------------
Features of js:-
---------------
     - programming language(Scripting language)
     - used to provide behaviour to a web application
     - it is used in both frontend as well as backend
       - initialyy js was introduced as frontend language
       - v8 engine is to run js in browser
       - forntend-behavioural
       - backend-logical operations
       - nodejs environment-has v8 engine to run the js outside the browser
     - it is categorized as dynamically typed language
       - dynamically typed language-datatype changes according to the assigned value
       - statically typed language-typeScript
     - single thread programming language-line by line execution
     - it suppot both procedural(react) and object oriented (oops)
     (angular
     )paradigm(style of programming)
----------------------Procedural programming-----------------------
-programming paradigm where series of computational steps are carried out .unlike oops procedural programming consider both data and methods as two diff entities. 
- js file - filename.js

display
-------

console.log(content)
cntrl j -to open terminal in vs code
            
 to run a file
 -------------

 node filename.js

 datatypes
 ---------
 -Two types:-

   1)primitive datatype
     - base type
     - immutable -can't change the original value ,but can reassign the value.
     - 1)String -sequence of characters
               -eg: 'text' , "text"
       2)number -represents integer and floating point numbers
             -eg: 25 , 25.0
       3)bigInt -it represent larger number outside the boundary of number category
              -eg:2^53
       4)null -intentional absence of value
             -eg:let x = null 
       5)undefined -not assigned a value     
             -eg: let x
       6)boolean -logical value( true or false)
       7)symbol -used to uniquely identify a content
                -used to creating libraries
                -let variable = symbol('content')

   2)non primitive datatype 
     - derived datatype
     - mutable-can change and reassign values 
     -8)object - data is stored in key:value pairs
        - eg: array , object , functions etc.........   
        - it is combination of primitive datatype.


variable
----------
 
 - used to store data
 - identifiers - rules to create variables
         - variable name can have alphabets , numbers , underscore , etc
        - variable name should not start with digit but subsequent characters can be digits
        -  if the variable name contains more than one word , the words shouldn't have space
        - camelcase - variableName
        - snakecase - variable_name
    - variable names are case sensitive
          car CAR Car caR - all these are considered as separate variables
 syntax
 --------
  variable_name = value
  keyword variable_name = value

  keyword
  -------
   - set of reserved words
   - it gives special meaning to the variables
   1)var - new value can be reassigned , redeclaration allowed , hoisting possible , global scope
   2)const - reassigning is not possible , redeclaration not allowed , hoisting not possible , global scope
   3)let - reassigning possible , redeclaration not allowed , block{} level scope , hoisting not possible

   Hoisting
   --------
    - using a variable before it is declared

    Template literals
    -----------------
        - way of displaying content.
        syntax
        console.log(`content ${variable}`)

   concatenation
   --------------
      -add up of data 
      -string + string =string
      - string + number = string
      -number + number = number

    operators
   ----------         
        1)Assignment (=)
        2)Arithmetic
          + - / * %(remainder) **(exponential)
        3)Relational operations
           < , > , <= , >= , [== , ===](comparison)
           -Returns boolean values
           - == compare only values
           - === compare value and datatype
        4)Logiical operators
           - between one or more ralational operators
             -return boolean value
            1)AND (&&) 

               T && T = T
               T && F = F
               F && T = F
               F && F = F

            2)OR (||)

               T && T = T
               T && F = T
               F && T = T
               F && F = F

            3)NOT (!)
                 !F = T
                 !T = F
5)increment(++) or decrement(--) operators                
            
            x ++                x--

            x = x+1             x = x-1
   -the position of the operation is important
   ++x inside console will gives one added  value while
   x++ will gives the value of x itself

6)shorthand operators  
     x = x+1  =x+=1(same variable in both lhs and rhs)
7)ternary operators
syntax:
    -condition?true statements : false statement
    -condition?statement : condition?statement :..........
8)truthy operator(used if only one condition)
    -condition && true statement   
9)spread operator
10)rest operator
    
conditional statements / decision making statements
------------------------------------------------------
   -execute based on the condition 
1)if else statements

     if(condition){
      statements
     }
     else if(condition) {
      statement
     }
     else{
      statements
     }

     -only one state execute at a time.

     -------------------looping statements-------------
     -cntrl c -forcefull stopping of run
     - used to execute a set of code repeatedly at a  particular part of a program file.
     - to exit a loop, the condition must be false.
     1)while
      -don't know number of iteration
           syntax:
                variable initialization
                while(condition){
                  statements


                  exit condition/increment or decrement statements
                }
      
     2)for
     -knows number of iteration
       for(variable initialization ; condition ;exit condition){
        statement
       }
- break -forcefully exit a parent loop
3)nested loop -pattern printing
 -loop within a loop

 Function
 ---------
 -Used to do tasks repeatedly at different position of a programming file
 - to reduce boiler plates(repeated statements)
 -2 parts 
 1)function definition 
 2)fuction call

 syntax
 ------

 fumction fname(){
  statement
 }

 fname(arg/para/empty)[function call]

 -function call is mandatory inorder to execute a task
 -data coming from outside must be passed as arg/parameter
    -arguments are actual values
    -parameters are variables
 -variables inside a function is having functional scope -can't access directly outside the function 
 -inorder to access variable ouside the fn -return the variable
 -any code after return statement willnot execute
  
Arrow function(ES6)
--------------

 syntax
 ------
  const variable_name = (arguments/parameters)=> statement or {statements}
  variable_name()  

 advantage
 ---------
 -syntax is less compared to regular function
 -if arrow fn is having single statement then automatic return
 -better performance

 functional hoisting
 -------------------
 -calling a fn bfore it is defined.
 -possible for normal fn.arrow fn doesnt support hoisting

 types of functions
 -----------------

 1)predefined fns
 -----------------
 -these are builtin fns for js.
 -no need to define the fn.
 eg:console.log() , math.floor() , math.parseInt() , eval() , string() , number() , typeOf()  etc....

 2)callback fns(fq4)
 --------------
 -fns that are passed as an argument to another fn and executed later by the parent fn.

 3)Nested fn(fq5)
 -----------
 -fns defining inside another fn
 -closure property-variables inside the parent fn can be accessed inside the child funtion but child variable can't access in the parent fn.

 4)synchronous fn
 ----------------
 -functions wihtout any time delay

 5)asynchronous fn(fq6)
 ------------------
 -functions with time delay in execution
 eg: setTimeout , API

 Datastructures
 ---------------
 -a specialized format for organizing,processing,retrieving, and storing data
 eg: linkedlist ,array,tree,stack,queue,graph etc .......

 -Array
 ------
 -Unlike variables arrays can hold more than one data
 -definition:array is a single variable that can store more than one data of different datatpes that are separated by commas and enclosed within square bracket.

 syntax
 ------
 arrayname = [data1,data2,data3,......]
 -each item in the array is given an index  value starts with 0 - (length-1)
 -number of items - length (total of location) 
 -stored as an object
 {
  key:value = index:data
 }
 ways to access each items from an array
 ---------------------------------------
 1)normal for loop-used to return items from a specific index .
 2)for in-directly return indexes of the array
 3)for of- return directly the item

 Array operations
 ----------------
 1)push() - to add item to end of an array 
 2)unshift() - to add item to start of an array
 3)pop() - remove last item from the array
 4)shift() - to remove the first item from the array
 5)sort() - to arrange the array in ascending or descending order(fq14)
 -------------------APRIL 9----------------------
 6)forEach()-to access each item from an array-for loops(fq20)
     syntax:
          array.forEach((variable)=>statement)
 7)map()-to access each item from an array 
         -it returns a new array of the same number of items in parent array  (FQ20)    

      syntax:

         newArray = parentArray.map((variable)=>statement)

 8)reduce() -iterate through the array and return a single value from the array  
  eg: lowest,highest,sum,etc....

   syntax:

       value = array.reduce((previousValue, currentValue)=>statement)   

 9)filter - return a new array having elements satisfying a specific condition 

      syntax:

          newArray = parentArray.filter((variableName)=>condition)   

  10)some() - it returns boolean value based on the condition         
  11)find() - returns first element satisfying the condition.
            syntax:

             value = parentArray.find(variable_name=>condition)

  12)flat(depth)-used to change the dimension of an array
                -depth refers how deep a nested array need to be flattened.
                -without passing depth,it will change to the dimension just below the current dimension.(if 4d then changes to 3d)
                -infinity-changes directly to 1d

  13)includes()-To check whether a given item is present in the array or not.              
          syntax:
            array.includes('item')

  14)splice()-To add or remove items at different postions in an array   
            syntax:
            array.splice(stratindex , count_of_remove ,items_to_added)

  15)indexOf()-to get index of an element   
  16)lastIndexOf()-to get the last index of the element
  17)slice()-it gives a sub array from aparent array     
            -ending index will be excluded           
            syntax:
                 array.slice(startIndex , endIndex)
  18)reduceRight()-iteration starts at last element of an array               

---------------MONDAY APRIL 7-----------------

 1)linear search
 
 2) binary search- time cunsumption br reducing the number of    iteration
        -prerequisite- the given array is should be in ascending order.

     
    Algorithm
   ----------
   -it is the step by step procedure/instruction to solve a question.
     -algorithm should be written in between start and end
      

   Flow characters
   ---------------
   -pictorial representation of an algorithm   





   Nested array : array within an array

   string
   ------
   -sequence of characters

   methods
   -------
   1)startsWith()-checks whether a string starts with a  specific character.
            -case sensitive
            -returns aboolean value
   2)endsWith()-checks whether a string ends with a particular sequence
             -case sensitive
            -returns aboolean value
   3)toUpperCase()-to convert a string into capital letters   
   4)toUpperCase()-to convert a string into small letters   
   5)substring()-to create a sub sring from a given string

        string.substring(start, end)
        -ending index will be excluded.so only startin index is provided.
   6)slice(start ,end) - to get a small portion of a string     
       -ending index will be excluded
       accepts negative values as well(negative index starts from -1) 
   7)trim()-to remove space in a given string from leading (start)and tailing(end)   
   8)replace()-To replace the first matching searchItem in a string

            string.replace(searchValue , endValue)
   9)replaceAll()-removes all matching searchItem   
   10)Array.from()-to get all characters of a string as array
   11)split(separator)-divide the string based on aseparator and returns an array      

  naming convention
  -----------------
  1)camel case = myVariableName
  2) pascal case = myVariableName 
  3)camel case = my_variable_name
  4) pascal case = my-variable-name 
  5) screaming snake case =  MY_VARIABLE_NAME    


  -----> array is mutable and string is immutable       
                  
    object(fq25) 
            
    ------
  Unlike array, it can store more than one data of different datatypes with more clarity.
  definition: object is a single variable that can store more than one data of different datatypes as key:value pair that are separated by commas and enclosed within curly brackets.             
   syntax:
   objectname ={
    key1:value1,
    key2:value2,......
   }
           
   -to access a single data ,
       -objectname['key']-can be used for 'exact key' or variable key
       -objectName.key (dot operator)   -only if there is exact key     

           

-for in is used to access of keys in an object

add data
--------

objectname['key'] = value
object.assign(target,{key:value})

update data
-----------

objectname[key] = value

delete data
----------

delete objectname.key

OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING SYSTEM -oops
-----------------------------------------

-it is a modern programming paradigm(style) which consider real time entities into class and objects.
 
 Basics
 ------
 1) class -blueprint which contains common features from which different objects are created
 2)object - real time entity created from the class
 3)reference- actual memory location where properties and  methods are stored.


-property - it is the variable inside a class.
-method - functions inside a class
-instance variable- used to access the properties inside the class  

  syntax for class
  ----------------

  class Classname {
    //properties
    //constructors
    //method
  }

  -constructors are used for initializing the property.it is a predefined method.contructors invokes first when an instance for a class is created.
  -not mandatory to place all the above components inside the class always.

  syntax for object
  ----------------

  const objectname = new classname()

syntax of constructors
----------------------
constructors(){
   
}

pillers of oops
---------------
1)inheritance - classical inheritance
2)poymorphism
3)encapsulation
4)abstraction

inheritance (eg : oops4.js)
-----------

- used to access methods and properties from one class to another.
- parent class - the class from which data is taken
               - also called super class/base class.
- child class - the class  which access the data
              -also called derived class/ subclass
-keyword used to inherit data is extends   

Types of classical inheritance
-----------------------------

1)single inheritance(oops4) -directly support in js
2)multi-level inheritance(oops5)-directly support in js
3)heirarchial inheritance(oops6)-directly support in js

4)multiple inheritance- partially support in js
5)hybrid inheritance- partially support in js

polymorphism
-------------
-real time eg:payment gateways
poly - many 
morphism - forms

1)Method overloading
2)method overriding

   Method overloading
   ------------------
   -Method with same name but different arguments.
   -execute based on number of argument
   -js not support method overloading directly.(oops7.js)
   -rest operator (...)- it make the arguments into an array

   method overriding
   -----------------
   -methods with same name and same number of arguments
   -execute the last written method.
   -js supports method overriding.
   -used to add special features to subclass in inheritance

Encapsulation
-------------
 -Binding od data and functions to be performed on that data into a single unit(class)
 
abstraction
-----------
the process of hiding the internal details of an application from the outer world.

Exception handling
------------------
Exception - run time error

 -try-catch block

syntax
------

try{
  statement
}
catch{
  statement  -execute only when there is error in try block
}
finally{
  statement -execute in both case
}

-----------------------------------------------------------

JS IN frontend
--------------

-Run by browser
-Browser - it is an application program that provides an interface to interact with all the informations or resources available in internet or www.
-html,css,xml,js are languages which can run by browser.
-js provides behaviour to the web page.
-js access the dom structure to provide the behaviour

DOM -document object model
--------------------------

-tree structure of html document.
-it is created by browser.
